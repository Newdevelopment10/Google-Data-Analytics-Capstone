# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone
This is my capstone data analysis project for Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
The project consists of using annual data from 2023 to gain insight into how annual (subscription) and casual riders differ.
From there, the analysis will be used to give Marketing information for a campaign to convert casual riders into annual members of Cyclistic.
The data is from Lyft, who is partnering with Coursera and Google to allow their students to use the raw data for educational purposes.
